# @nodeproto/tests - various monorepo tests

## TLDR

- consumers should use this package as a reference for their integrations

- `integration`
  - integration tests for all publishable pks
  - after running tests issue `cd dist && pnpm serve`
    - open your browser to `localhost:5000`
    - navigate through the various folders for some manual QA
