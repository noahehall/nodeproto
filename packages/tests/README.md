# @nodeproto/tests - various monorepo tests

## TLDR

- consumers should use this package as a reference for their integrations

- `integration`
  - integration tests for all publishable pks
- `index.mjs`
  - `import { test }` no frills test runner for node. based on `assert` module


## todos
  - update exports so only testrunner can be imported
